## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run the project locally? Here's how to get it up and running on your machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Antot-12/Spekulus.git
cd Spekulus
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
This project uses `npm` for package management.
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, fill in the `.env` file with your credentials:
```env
# Neon Serverless Postgres connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."

**4. Push the database schema:**
Drizzle ORM manages our database. This command will sync your `schema.ts` file with your Neon database.

**5. Seed the database:**
This command populates your database with the initial content (text, roadmap events, etc.) needed to run the site.
```bash
npm run db:seed
